Drive your ball to follow the straight line in space and avoid obstacles as they crash through the race. With high speed and racetrack in space, slope game improves your reflexes and reactions, provides hours of fun, and relaxes. If you enjoy high-speed platform games, you will be addicted to this game after the first play. Players only need to use the keyboard arrow keys to play the Slope. The real-time gameplay is flexible and players only have to change their movements small enough. The ball's gestures get pronounced as players keep up keyboard keys for longer. Just drive the ball and guid it around the racetrack. Note that the racetrack is infinite - no levels or stages are needed to finish. Only try to keep the ball to a high score as long as possible!">
